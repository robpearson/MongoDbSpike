# MongoDbSpike
Simple Spike to explore MongoDB.

## Goals

Exploring NoSQL and MongoDB by trying to implement saving/retrieving data from hitting some fictional example endpoints.

- [ ] https://api.maplepixel.io/transit/timetables/2015-05-02 - GET Transit timetables
- [ ] https://api.maplepixel.io/settings/favouritetrip/ - POST to save a new favourite trip
- [ ] https://api.maplepixel.io/settings/favouritetrip/1 - GET to retrieve an existing favourite trip

Interested to see how easy it is to define the data model (if needed) and time to persist/retrieve data.

## Requirements

Built w/ Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 and .NET 4.5.  Using NUnit 2.x and Moq for testing.
